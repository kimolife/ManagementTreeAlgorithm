# Getting Started

This is just a simple Project that prints a list of employees in a Management Tree Format

This project contains:

* A main application file to kickoff the project `RunApplication.java`
* A Data Object `Employee.java`
* An util which contains the main logic for printing the Tree `EmployeeUtils.java`
* All other files are just default Spring boot project files.


Steps to run the application
* Import Project as a Maven Project (Click Next all the way)
* Just compile and run the `main()` method in `RunnApplication.java`
